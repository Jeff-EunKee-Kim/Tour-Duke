# Tour@Duke

A website that allows users to search through unique attractions at Duke, plan/save a trip, and discuss in a forum. 

## Motivation/Goals

I was inspired to work on this project when I first visited Duke in high school. The campus was simply too big for one to look around all the attractions at Duke, and as a prospective student, I wanted to see the true campus life of Duke students rather than the beautiful/fancy looking buildings. I felt the need of something more student-oriented tour guide rather than tourist-oriented guide. Once I learned how to make websites and learned the essentials to build this website, I decided to come up with this website with a close friend.
